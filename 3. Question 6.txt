Advantages of using OO
1. Makes the code more organised.
2. Allows for code reuse in another file.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. Easy to search items in dictionary.
2. Easy to edit and make data.

Disadvantage of using OO
1. Codes using OO are complex and mistakes are likely to be made in making codes.
2. Complex to understand, and may not be easy to extract data. 

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. Consumes lot of memory 
2. Tough to store complex data.

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two
approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1000
2. Time by OO: 3.88094949722290004
3. Time by dictionary: 0.00199151039312353516
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 5.26 x 10^-4
